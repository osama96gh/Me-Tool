# Active Context

## Current Focus
Testing and refinement of core functionality

## Recent Decisions
1. Implemented category-based command organization
2. Created smart command resolution for direct commands
3. Designed modular category system
4. Added comprehensive help system
5. Implemented intelligent project type detection

## Active Considerations
- Testing strategy for each category
- Command completion implementation
- Installation process
- User documentation
- Configuration system design

## Implementation Progress
- Core functionality complete
- All primary categories implemented:
  - Git operations
  - Directory navigation
  - System commands
  - Project management
- Command parsing and routing working
- Help system implemented

## Next Actions
1. Test each category thoroughly
2. Implement YAML configuration
3. Create installation script
4. Add command completion
5. Write user documentation
6. Review extending.md documentation for completeness

Note: A new extending.md guide has been added to document the process of adding new shortcuts and tools to the system. This documentation should be reviewed and updated as the system evolves.

## Current Challenges
- Ensuring cross-platform compatibility
- Maintaining consistent behavior across categories
- Optimizing command resolution performance
- Balancing flexibility with simplicity
